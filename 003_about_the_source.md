# About this Source
In 1782, Catherine the Great ordered a vast expansion of the Russian Empire's postal services. Catherine had just completed a fundamental reform of the empire's governance.  She had divided Russia into 30 provinces (with more to be added later), and subdivided each province into districts.  Since the reign of her predecessor, Peter I (1689-1725), the posts had provided mail and transport services connecting St. Petersburg and Moscow to the empire's chief cities. Catherine wanted these services now expanded to encompass every district town, as well.

Aleksandr Bezborodko, the recently named Director of the Postal Department, took charge of this project. He commissioned a celebrated architect named Nikolai Lvov (1753-1803) to draw the plan presented here.  Post offices, Bezborodko told Russia's provincial officials, were exactly the kind of "public buildings" Catherine wanted them to build.  He provided them with copies of this plan, as an example of how to do it.

In its basic conception, the station takes a very traditional form, that of an enclosed courtyard [aerial view, bottom left]. Russian relay stations (and indeed peasant households) had had this form for hundreds of years, being composed of a main house and outbuildings surrounded by a fence. As in those constructions, stables, barns for hay and other provisions, storage sheds, and a root cellar line the interior of the courtyard in L’vov’s design. In the corners by its main gate sit rooms for the gatekeeper (on the left) and the “postillions” (that is, the local relay coachmen, on the right), each watch room equipped with a fireplace or stove. Though dressed in clean, neo-classical lines, this outer rim of the station connects it to the more traditional world of relay service in Russia. 

Within this frame, however, L’vov envisions the postmaster’s house as a Palladian cube, a two-story building adorned with a temple-mount front. This main building contains the post office itself, with rooms for a variety of services. First, there is room for letter mail. The building’s main entrance way (at ‘a’ on the first floor) is equipped with a counter and small window for receiving letters (marked NB). The workspace of the postmaster is at left (b), on the other side of the window. The rest of the first floor contains waiting rooms for (paying) travelers, official couriers, and mail carriers (pochtari), alongside a kitchen for dining services, and servants quarters. The postmaster’s bedroom and family quarters are on the second floor, along with sleeping rooms for travelers. (L’vov’s own signature on this plan can be seen in the center, along with that of his assistant, Grigorii Protopov).    

As a public building, then, L’vov’s post office serves as an interface between the traditional, courtyard arrangement of relay obligations in Russia’s villages and towns and the remodeled services (mail, travel, hoteling, and eventually money orders1) which Catherine and her advisers hoped to use to turn them into a revenue-generating engine. 
	
How many of these stations were built exactly like this? The plan itself indicates (in an inscription at center) that it should be adapted "as space allows." Archival records suggest that in the end, most district post offices were in fact located in the rooms of rented buildings: that is to say, they weren't in specially built buildings at all.

All the same, L’vov’s plans show what the “proper posts” of the Catherinean imagination were supposed to look like: what an imperial welfare institution tucked inside the structure of imperial labor practices could be.
