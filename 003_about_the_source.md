# About this Source
Nikolai Aleksandrovich L'vov was born on his family's serf estate, in northwest Russia, in 1751. At the age of sixteen, he left for St. Petersburg, and enrolled as an artilleryman in the prestigious Izmailovsky Regiment.  Before long, however, he transferred to civil service in the Empire's College of Foreign Affairs, under the protection of the powerful diplomat Petr Vasilievich Bakunin.  At Bakunin's house, he was surrounded by enthusiasts for the latest European fashions in literature, music, theater, and art.  Young L'vov himself rapidly earned a reputation as a gifted "genius of taste," showing remarkable talent in all of these areas.  His education into a Renaissance man of Russian Enlightenment culture was completed in 1776-1777, when he accompanied an ailing patron on a tour around Europe, including stops in Cologne, the Netherlands, London, Paris, Madrid, and Rome.[^1]

Upon his return to Russia, L'vov acquired a powerful new client: Aleksandr Andreevich Bezborodko (1747-1799).  Like L'vov, Bezborodko (from a cossack family in Ukraine) had gotten his start in St. Petersburg in the College of Foreign Affairs.  By 1780, however, he had become Catherine II's personal secretary and *de facto* chancellor.  No piece of correspondence—foreign or domestic—reached the empress without first passing through Bezborodko's hands, and the empress relied upon him to execute her most important plans.  Bezborodko, in turn, came to depend on the talented L'vov to help realize them.[^2]

In December of 1781, Catherine made Bezborodko the Director of Russia's Postal Department.  She simultaneously gave him a big job.[^3]  Catherine was completing a major reform of how the empire was governed, intended to "make easier the best and most precise execution of those beneficial acts promulgated hereafter."[^4] To wit, Catherine had divided her empire's vast provinces into 33 smaller units of local administration, which could work with local elites to govern local societies more closely and respond more quickly to central commands.  These new local governments (or 'provinces,' as they are called in English) each had a centrally-appointed governor, a capital city, and a provincial office with clerks and officers to serve it. (By Catherine's death the number of provinces had grown to 41.)[^5]

Catherine's vast expansion of local imperial governance demanded an equally dramatic expansion of Russia's postal roads.  Merely connecting all the new provincial capitals and district towns with St. Petersburg and Moscow meant multiplying the number of relay stations and post offices many times over.  Yet Catherine wanted regular (weekly) mail deliveries and on-demand transportation services through a much more refined network than that.  She ordered Bezborodko (and the governors of the new provinces) to plan a system of five interlocking levels. The first would connect the chief city of each province to the two imperial capitals; the second would connect the cities of neighboring provinces; the third—each provincial city with its district towns; the fourth—district towns with one another; and the last each district town all the way back up to St. Petersburg and Moscow.[^6]

The number of relays—and the burden of maintaining them—grew correspondingly.  In 1769 (before the provincial reform) there were 574 relay stations in the Russian Empire, according to one trustworthy account.  By 1801, there were 3,222.  Most of these stations—known simply as *stantsii* or *stany*—were simple stops where local people would provide 2-4 horses and 1-2 coachmen for relay service.  Even so, this required a seven-fold increase in the number of horses harnessed for relay duty, from 4,895 (in 1775) to 37,840 (in 1801).  In addition, the number of post offices—known as *pochtovye kontory* ('post offices') or *pochtovye dvory* (post-yards)—grew rapidly as well.  These offices were found in provincial capitals and district towns.  They marked the terminus of mail routes (street delivery did not begin in the Russian Empire until the nineteenth century), and also housed the postmasters who oversaw district and provincial mails more generally.  In 1781, there were 73 such post offices in the empire. By 1801, there were 450. [^7]

From the beginning, Catherine claimed to be worried about the burdens this increased postal service—born, as in centuries past, by local subjects as a form of imperial obligation—might place on the new provincial society.  She told her governors that they should seek every means to place the new stations on the most profitable footing possible.  By collecting fees for services—such as letter mail, travel by post, food and shelter, and money transfers—they should in time be able to make the posts pay for themselves (or so she claimed).  In the meantime, she instructed Bezborodko that the construction of local post offices should be paid for out of the funds she had allocated each province for "public buildings."[^8]

To create designs for these locations, Bezborodko turned to L'vov.  It is not entirely clear how, or even when, the young man acquired his architectural training.  During his European journey of 1776-1777, L'vov saw many major European cities and no sketched and took notes about what he saw.  His first major project—a cathedral to commemorate the meeting between Catherine and the Habsburg Emperor Joseph II in 1780—pleased the Russian Empress greatly.  She sent him abroad again, this time to study art and architecture in earnest for six months, mostly in Italy.  When he returned, he brought a beautiful four-volume edition of Andrea Palladio's _The Four Books of Architecture_ with him.  Across the next two decades, he became one of neoclassical architecture's great exponents in Russia, building dozens of public buildings, churches, and civilian estates in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Tver Province.[^9]
