## About this Source

Nikolai Aleksandrovich L'vov was born on his family's serf estate, in northwest Russia, in 1751. At the age of sixteen, he left for St. Petersburg, and enrolled as an artilleryman in the prestigious Izmailovsky Regiment.  Before long, however, he transferred to civil service in the Empire's College of Foreign Affairs, under the protection of the powerful diplomat Petr Vasilievich Bakunin.  At Bakunin's house, he was surrounded by enthusiasts for the latest European fashions in literature, music, theater, and art.  Young L'vov himself rapidly earned a reputation as a gifted "genius of taste," showing remarkable talent in all of these areas.  His education into a Renaissance man of Russian Enlightenment culture was completed in 1776-1777, when he accompanied an ailing patron on a tour around Europe, including stops in Cologne, the Netherlands, London, Paris, Madrid, and Rome.[^1]

Upon his return to Russia, L'vov acquired a powerful new client: Aleksandr Andreevich Bezborodko (1747-1799).  Like L'vov, Bezborodko (from a cossack family in Ukraine) had gotten his start in St. Petersburg in the College of Foreign Affairs.  By 1780, however, he had become Catherine II's personal secretary and *de facto* chancellor.  No piece of correspondence—foreign or domestic—reached the empress without first passing through Bezborodko's hands, and the empress relied upon him to execute her most important plans.  Bezborodko, in turn, came to depend on the talented L'vov to help realize them.[^2]

In December of 1781, Catherine made Bezborodko the Director of Russia's Postal Department.  She simultaneously gave him a big job.[^3]  Catherine was completing a major reform of how the empire was governed, intended to "make easier the best and most precise execution of those beneficial acts promulgated hereafter."[^4] To wit, Catherine had divided her empire's vast provinces into 33 smaller units of local administration, which could work with local elites to govern local societies more closely and respond more quickly to central commands.  These new local governments (or 'provinces,' as they are called in English) each had a centrally-appointed governor, a capital city, and a provincial office with clerks and officers to serve it.[^5]
