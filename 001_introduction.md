# Introduction

Like most of history's overland empires, the Russian Empire relied on animal-powered relays (or "posts") to run its official communications.  The princes of Moscow began to organize this service in the late 15th century.  They established relay stations at regular intervals along important roads (generally 15-25 miles apart).  They required local communities to maintain fresh horses at these stations.  (At some stations, dogs, reindeer, human rowers or even porters provided this horse-power.)  Bouncing up to such a relay station and producing an official post-order, the Tsars' couriers and servitors could claim these horses at these stations, as well as new coachmen and vehicles to work them. Regular mail service was added along these roads in the late seventeenth century.  Starting under Peter I (1689-1725), civilians could purchase post-orders and travel and send mail through these postal roads as well. [^1]

For nearly three hundred years (ca. 1480-1780), the imperial Russian government seems to have paid little attention to the architecture of these relay stations.  Local communities, as far as we can tell, housed the posts inside their own wooden homes and courtyards, or built separate huts and outbuildings for them on the same model.  In 1782, however, the St. Petersburg government sent provincial governors a stately new set of neoclassical designs for the empire's post offices. Their author was Nikolai L'vov (1753-1804), a Russian nobleman and servitor in the imperial College of Foreign Affairs.

A copy of one of these plans—a model district post-yard, designed by L'vov—is preserved today in the Russian State Historical Archive (RGIA, St. Petersburg).[^2]  As a primary source, this model plan illuminates an important juncture in the history of imperial Russian communications.  It allows us today to explore just how the architects of Russia's Enlightenment sought to house the ancient imperial obligation of relay service within their plans for the empire's future.

This micro-edition presents an [annotated digital facsimile of this plan](https://jwr12.github.io/imperial_russian_post_office_1782/002_source.html), based on an archival photograph taken by the Russian State Historical Archive in 2010.   An accompanying [essay](https://jwr12.github.io/imperial_russian_post_office_1782/003_about_the_source.html) situates this design within L'vov's life as an architect, the Catherinean government's attempts to reform Russia's provinces, and the longer, imperial history of communications in Russia.
