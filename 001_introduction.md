Like most of history's overland empires, the Russian Empire relied on animal-powered relays (or "posts") to run its official communications, from its foundations in the late fifteenth century through its demise in the early twentieth.  

First, tsarist officials identified routes along which they wanted to site relays.  They chose spots for relay stations at regular intervals (some 15-25 miles apart) along these roads.  They would then require local communities—as one of their obligations to the empire—to supply drivers, wagons, food, fodder, and shelter to these stations, and above all draft animals.  (This horse-power generally took the form of horses, but in some locations dogs, reindeer, and even human porters were used.).  Bouncing up to a such post, an imperial mail-carrier or courier would present his post-order, take fresh horses (or dogs or reindeer), wagons (or sleds), and local coachmen as needed, and proceed along to the next station. Soldiers and other servitors traveling on the tsars' business also traveled on this system. After the reign of Peter I (1689-1725), paying civilian travelers could buy post-orders as well. [^1]

For the first three hundred years of the system's existence (ca. 1480-1780), the imperial Russian government seems to have paid little attention to the architecture of these posting stations.  Local communities, as far as we can tell, housed them inside their own wooden homes and courtyards, or built huts and outbuildings for them on the same model.  In 1782, however, the imperial government sent Russia's provincial governors a stately set of new designs for the construction of post offices.  Their author was Nikolai L'vov (1753-1804), a Russian nobleman and servitor in the College of Foreign Affairs who was just beginning what turned out to be a profoundly influential career as perhaps the foremost exponent of neoclassical architecture in Russia.

A copy of one of these plans—a model district post office, designed by L'vov—is preserved today in St. Petersburg's Russian State Historical Archive (RGIA), amidst the papers of the Postal Department.[^2]  As a source, this model drawing illuminates an important juncture in the history of imperial Russian communications.  It shows how L'vov sought to house the ancient imperial obligation of relay service within the emerging civilian architecture of Russia's Enlightenment. 

This micro-edition presents an [annotated digital copy of this plan](https://jwr12.github.io/imperial_russian_post_office_1782/002_source.html), based on an archival photograph taken by the Russian State Historical Archive in 2010.   An accompanying [essay](https://jwr12.github.io/imperial_russian_post_office_1782/003_about_the_source.html) situates the drawing within L'vov's work as an architect, Catherine the Great's attempts to reform how local society was governed, and the longer, imperial history of communications in Russia.
