# Introduction

In 1782, the Russian nobleman Nikolai L'vov prepared a "Model Plan for a District Post-Yard."  This drawing is preserved in St. Petersburg in a clean manuscript copy held by the Russian State Historical Archive[^1].  As a source, L'vov's plan illuminates an important juncture in the history of imperial Russian communications.  It shows how one of the leading architects of the Russian Enlightenment imagined housing one of the Russian Empire's oldest practices--relay obligation--within the structures of the empire's newly-reformed provincial order.

This micro-edition presents an [annotated digital copy of L'vov's plan](https://jwr12.github.io/imperial_russian_post_office_1782/002_source.html), based on an archival photograph taken by the Russian State Historical Archive in 2010.  An accompanying [essay](https://jwr12.github.io/imperial_russian_post_office_1782/003_about_the_source.html) situates the drawing within L'vov's work, the grand reform of local administration undertaken by Catherine II in the 1770s and 1780s, and the longer history of relay service in the Russian Empire.
