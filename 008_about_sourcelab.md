# About MinDoc

This micro-edition was built using *MinDoc*, a free, web-based, minimal computing template for digital documentary editions developed in 2023 by Liza Senatorova, John Randolph, and Caroline Kness, as part of the [SourceLab](https://sourcelab.history.illinois.edu/) initiative at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Founded in 2015, is a student-led digital humanities collective. It sponsors classes, public events, and digital experiments that explore the intersection between classroom instruction, information technology, and the future of the historical record.
